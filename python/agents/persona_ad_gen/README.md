# Persona Ad Gen - AI-Powered Advertising Scene Generator

This project implements an AI-powered advertising content generator that transforms user photos into compelling, persona-driven advertising scenes. The agent guides users through a story-driven brief collection process, automatically generates headlines, and creates multiple advertising scenes tailored to specific target audiences.

## Overview

The Persona Ad Gen agent is designed to revolutionize advertising content creation by focusing on the human story behind every great ad. Instead of traditional form-filling, it engages users in a conversational journey to understand their ideal customer's problems, desires, and motivations. The agent then leverages this deep understanding to generate visually compelling advertising scenes that resonate with the target audience.

### Agent Architecture

The agent is built using a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

1. **PersonaAdGenAgent (Main Orchestrator)**
   - Guides users through the 5-section story collection process
   - Manages session state and workflow progression
   - Coordinates with sub-agents for specialized tasks

2. **CreativeAgent (Sub-agent)**
   - Generates 4 unique advertising scenes based on the persona brief
   - Utilizes Gemini's image generation capabilities
   - Creates scene-specific prompts optimized for visual impact

3. **Headline Generation System**
   - Automatically creates compelling headlines after brief collection
   - Generates multiple options based on persona, message, and tone
   - Integrates seamlessly into the workflow without user intervention

### Workflow Stages

1. **The Ideal Customer (Persona)** - Understanding the target audience's problems and desires
2. **The 'Aha!' Moment (Core Message)** - Defining the solution in one powerful sentence
3. **The Conversation (Tone of Voice)** - Selecting the appropriate communication style
4. **The Creative Toolbox (Assets & Copy)** - Uploading base images and generating headlines
5. **The Targeting Signals (Audience Foundation)** - Collecting demographic and interest data

### Key Features

- **Multi-Scene Image Generation:**
  - Transforms uploaded images into 4 distinct advertising scenes
  - Each scene tells a different aspect of the brand story
  - Optimized for various marketing channels

- **Session State Management:**
  - Maintains context throughout the conversation
  - Stores brief details, images, and generated content
  - Enables seamless workflow progression

- **Artifact Management:**
  - Saves all generated images as downloadable artifacts
  - Organized naming convention for easy identification
  - Integration with Google Cloud Storage for persistence

### Tools

The agent has access to the following tools:

- `create_persona_brief_without_headlines(persona: str, core_message: str, tone: str, location: str, demographics: str, interests: str) -> dict`: Creates the initial persona brief structure before headline generation.

- `generate_headlines(persona: str, core_message: str, tone: str) -> list[str]`: Automatically generates compelling headlines based on the persona story.

- `save_image_as_artifact(image_data: str) -> str`: Processes and saves uploaded images as artifacts for scene generation.

- `confirm_and_save_persona_brief(brief: dict) -> str`: Saves the complete creative brief to session state.

- `edit_scene_image(base_image: str, scene_prompt: str, scene_number: int) -> str`: Generates new advertising scenes based on edit prompts using the uploaded image as source.

- `debug_save_image(image_data: str, filename: str) -> str`: Debug utility for image processing and storage operations.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Google ADK SDK
- Google Cloud Project (for Vertex AI integration) or Google AI Studio API key
- GCS bucket for artifact storage

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**

   For the Agent Engine deployment steps, you will need a Google Cloud Project. Once you have created your project, [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Then run the following command to authenticate with your project:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```
   
   You also need to enable certain APIs. Run the following command to enable the required APIs:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
   cd adk-samples/python/agents/persona_ad_gen
   ```

   For the rest of this tutorial **ensure you remain in the `agents/persona_ad_gen` directory**.

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   If you have not installed poetry before then run `pip install poetry` first. Then you can create your virtual environment and install all dependencies using:

   **Note for Linux users:** If you get an error related to `keyring` during the installation, you can disable it by running the following command:
   ```bash
   poetry config keyring.enabled false
   ```
   This is a one-time setup.

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   To activate the virtual environment run:
   ```bash
   poetry env activate
   ```

4. Install evaluation dependencies (optional):

   For running evaluation tests, you need additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install "google-adk[eval]"
   
   # If using pipx for ADK installation
   pipx inject google-adk pandas tabulate rouge-score
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```bash
   # Google Cloud Project Configuration (global is must have for Gemini 2.5 Flash Images)
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global
   
   # Artifact Storage Configuration
   export ADK_ARTIFACT_SERVICE_TYPE=GCS
   export ADK_GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   
   # For Vertex AI (set to true if using Vertex AI)
   export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
   
   # For Google AI Studio (if not using Vertex AI)
   # export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=false
   # export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK command in your terminal from the root project directory:

1. Run agent in CLI:

   ```bash
   adk run persona_ad_gen
   ```

2. Run agent with ADK Web UI:

   ```bash
   adk web
   ```
   
   The web interface will be available at the URL printed in the console (typically http://localhost:5000)

3. Alternative execution methods:

   ```bash
   # Using the run script (if available)
   ./run_agent.sh
   
   # Direct Python execution
   python -m adk.web_server --app persona_ad_gen
   ```

### Example Interaction

Here's a typical interaction flow with the agent:

**User:**
hello

**Agent:**
Great ads connect with a real person by solving a real problem. Instead of just filling out a form, we're going to build your ad's story step-by-step. First, let's get to know your ideal customer.

Describe the single person you want to reach. What is a key problem, need, or desire they are currently facing that your business can help with?

**User:**
I want to reach busy professionals in their 30s who struggle to find time for fitness but want to stay healthy and look good.

**Agent:**
Perfect! You're targeting busy professionals who value their health but struggle with time management. Now, let's capture the core message.

Now, imagine that person sees your ad. In one powerful sentence, what is the solution or key takeaway you want them to have? This is the core message that will form the heart of your ad.

**User:**
"Get fit in just 20 minutes a day with workouts that fit your schedule, not the other way around."

**Agent:**
Excellent core message! It directly addresses their time constraint while promising results. Now let's think about the tone.

How should we speak to this person? Choose a Tone of Voice that would resonate with them (e.g., Professional, Empathetic, Witty, Urgent, Conversational, Inspiring).

**User:**
Inspiring and empathetic - understanding their struggle but motivating them to take action.

**Agent:**
Perfect tone choice! Inspiring and empathetic will resonate well with busy professionals who need both understanding and motivation.

You've defined the story, now let's gather the materials. Upload your most compelling image that will serve as the foundation for your advertising scenes.

**Agent:**
Perfect! Now I'll automatically generate compelling headlines for you based on your story.

```tool_code
generate_headlines(
    persona="busy professionals in their 30s struggling with time for fitness",
    core_message="Get fit in just 20 minutes a day with workouts that fit your schedule",
    tone="Inspiring and empathetic"
)
```

```tool_outputs
[
    "Your Schedule. Your Workout. Your Success.",
    "20 Minutes to Transform: Fitness That Fits Your Life",
    "Busy Schedule? We Get It. 20 Minutes Is All You Need.",
    "From Boardroom to Better Health in 20 Minutes",
    "Finally, Fitness That Respects Your Time"
]
```

## Evaluating the Agent

Evaluation tests assess the agent's conversation flow and response accuracy.

**Steps:**

1. **Run Evaluation Tests:**

   ```bash
   adk eval persona_ad_gen eval/data/persona_ad_gen_evalset.test.json
   ```

   Expected output:

agent_engine_id = "YOUR_AGENT_ENGINE_ID"  # Replace with actual ID
agent_engine = agent_engines.get(agent_engine_id)

# Create a new session
session = agent_engine.create_session(user_id="test_user")

# Stream interaction with the agent
for event in agent_engine.stream_query(
    user_id=session["user_id"],
    session_id=session["id"],
    message="Hello, I need help creating an ad campaign"
):
    for part in event["content"]["parts"]:
        print(part["text"])
```
